Wildcard permissions: `'<slug>:*'` grants every action on one collection or global, and `'*:<action>'` grants one action on every controlled entity, present and future (`'*:create'`/`'*:delete'` only ever match collections). Every check is wildcard-aware — access control, `hasPermission`/`requirePermission`, and the privilege-escalation guards, where holding `'pages:*'` covers granting `'pages:read'` and holding every action on an entity covers granting its `'<slug>:*'`, while `'*:<action>'` (like `'*'`) is only covered by holding it. A role whose `'*:<action>'` wildcards span all four actions is equivalent to `'*'` and counts as full access for the admin-role and break-glass guards. The permissions matrix renders wildcard grants as checked, locked cells and adds an "Everything" row for the `'*:<action>'` wildcards. New exports: `permissionCovers` and `fullAccessPermissions`.
