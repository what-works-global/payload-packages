# @whatworks/payload-utilities

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- d17dc89: Overhaul build, test, and release pipeline. Packages are now built with [tsdown](https://github.com/rolldown/tsdown) (rolldown-based) instead of swc, and emit a single ESM output with sourcemaps and bundled `.d.ts` files. Module resolution, bundled vs externalized deps, and tree-shaking behaviour may differ from prior releases — verify your build against the new output.

  Additionally, `@whatworks/payload-utilities` raises its peer-dep range for `payload`, `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical`, and `@payloadcms/translations` from `>=3.0.2` to `>=3.29.0`. The new floor reflects what the source actually requires: `@payloadcms/ui/utilities/getSchemaMap` was introduced in 3.2.0 and `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical/plaintext` was introduced in 3.29.0 — the package never worked on versions below the new floor.
